Qt State Machine Framework v1.1

This component adds an API for creating hierarchical finite state
machines. Note that this solution is experimental and work in
progress: No backwards compatibility (source nor binary) is
provided.

The State Machine Framework lets you define and run state
machines. It also includes tools to load or compile SCXML files.
